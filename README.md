# FlowBiz - Phase 1: Static Website

> ⚠️ **PHASE 1 SCOPE: WEBSITE ONLY**  
> This repository contains the FlowBiz static website (Phase 1) and backend template code.  
> **Only the website (`web/`) is active in Phase 1.**  
> Backend services are NOT deployed or active in Phase 1.

## Phase 1 Declaration

FlowBiz Phase 1 is a **presence and trust** establishment phase.

**What Phase 1 IS:**
- A clean, honest, static public website
- Thai-first content showing what we do and how we work
- Four pages: Home, What We're Building, Services (Now), Contact
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- Static HTML generated by Astro

**What Phase 1 IS NOT:**
- Not a platform, system, or app
- No backend, API, or server functions
- No authentication, dashboard, or user accounts
- No pricing, signup, or payment systems
- No overpromises or roadmap commitments
- No "AI replaces humans" or "guaranteed results" claims

Phase 1 presents FlowBiz as a small, focused team that helps businesses clarify and improve how they work.

## Quick Start - Website (Phase 1)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 

### Run the Website Locally

```bash
# Navigate to website directory
cd web/astro

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:4321
```

### Build Static Site

```bash
cd web/astro
npm run build

# Output in: web/astro/dist/
```

### Deploy

The website is deployed as static files only. See [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) for deployment instructions.

Recommended platforms:
- Cloudflare Pages
- Vercel
- Netlify

## Phase 1 Compliance

✅ **Confirmed:**
- Astro `output: "static"` mode
- No SSR adapters
- No server endpoints
- No `client:*` directives
- No backend modifications
- Thai-first language
- No forbidden claims
- Only allowed file paths modified

## Technology Stack (Phase 1)

- **Framework**: Astro 4.x (static mode)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS
- **Fonts**: Noto Sans Thai, Noto Sans
- **Assets**: SVG icons, static images

**No JavaScript** on the frontend (pure static HTML/CSS).

## Pages

1. **Home** (`/`) - Clear introduction to who we are and what we help with
2. **What We're Building** (`/building`) - Honest update on learning and experimentation
3. **Services** (`/services`) - What we can deliver today, with clear expectations
4. **Contact** (`/contact`) - Easy, low-pressure way to get in touch

## Design Principles

- Clean, soft, calm aesthetic
- White/off-white background
- Muted accent color (#6b7280)
- Generous spacing
- Mobile-first responsive
- No app-like UI patterns

## Content Policy

- Thai is primary everywhere
- English only for optional short subtitles (max 1 line)
- Honest tone: direct, calm, not salesy
- Clear about what we do and don't do
- No overpromises, no future features, no roadmap items

## What's NOT in Phase 1

The following are **NOT** included or active:
- Backend API (`apps/api`) - not deployed
- Core packages (`packages/core`) - not deployed
- Docker / docker-compose - not used
- Nginx - not configured
- Database - not set up
- Authentication - not implemented
- Dashboard - not built
- Analytics - not tracked (unless requested)

## Backend Development (Template Only)

The backend code exists as a **template** but is not active in Phase 1.

If you need to work on backend (future phases only):

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run application
python apps/api/main.py

# Run tests
pytest -q
```

**Important**: Backend is not deployed or active in Phase 1.

## Documentation

- **[Deploy Guide](deploy/README.md)** - Static website deployment
- **[ADR: System Nginx](docs/ADR_SYSTEM_NGINX.md)** - System architecture (future phases)
- **[Project Contract](docs/PROJECT_CONTRACT.md)** - API contracts (future phases)
